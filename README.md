After graduating, i decided to travel through Europe, scoping 11 countries and 14 cities. Managing this trip was challenging and for that reason i made this custom app just for personal use..and also for fun. 

Everything i used for the app development: 

1. **Rough sketches** of the general idea, design and functionalities
2. **Figma** for the layout design and for the icons, buttons etc
3. **Android Studio** framework for coding, using Kotling and XML
4. **AI chatbots** helping with the coding

# Figma

Using Figma, I designed the layout of every screen using custom-made buttons and icons.

# App-demo

I included a custom splash screen when the app launches before the main screen. 
## Main Screen
The app's **main screen** comprises of the map of Europe, markers for each city, a navigation bar where the user can interact and navigate through each city, a *a.Transaction Menu* and *b.Menu*.

**a. Transaction Menu**

Keeping track of who owes what and to whom can be frustrating during vacation. In the transaction menu, the user can choose the person that made the payment and the amount paid, then the app charges half of that amount to the other person and keeps track of the amound he owes until the clear button is pressed.

**b. Menu**

The menu contains three options. A *gallery screen* where the user can upload his favourite moments of each city into albums(*unfinished*), a *ticket screen*, where the user can upload and store all of his/her transportation tickets for convenience and a *packlist screen* where the user can keep track of his items so as not to forget anything. 

## Ticket Screen

This screen contains all the transportation tickets and/or other valuable documents. The user can press the add button and load a new ticket using the file explorer. Once loaded the ticket will appear on the screen and the user will be able to open it.
