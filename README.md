# Gulliver-App
After graduating, i decided to travel through Europe, scoping 11 countries and 14 cities. Managing this trip was challenging and for that reason i made this custom app just for personal use..and also for fun. 

Everything i used for the app development: 

1. **Rough sketches** of the general idea, design and functionalities
2. **Figma** for the layout design and for the icons, buttons etc
3. **Android Studio** framework for coding, using Kotling and XML
4. **AI chatbots** helping with the coding

# Figma

Using Figma, I designed the layout of every screen using custom-made buttons and icons.

# App-demo

The app's **main screen** comprises of the map of Europe, markers for each city, a navigation bar where the user can interact and navigate through each city, a *a.Transaction Menu* and *b.Menu*.
